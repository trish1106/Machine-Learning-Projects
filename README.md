## Project1: Product Review Sentiment Classification using a Logistic Classifier model
- I use the turicreate library as its highly sclable while working with large datasets.
- The dataset used is amazon_baby.sframe that contains multiple reviews of different products and ratings given by people for the product.
- A word count column is added to the dataset which contains the counts of each word in the reviews column for every product review.
- A sentiment column is added which defines a positive or negative sentimet for a product based on the ratings, a positive rating is if the value is above 4 and a negative rating is if the value is below 3.
- The model is built targeting the sentiments and the feature used is the word counts.
- The model is used to predict the sentiments of the prducts and compared to the actual sentiment based on the ratings.
- The model is evaluated on a specific product ( a toy Giraffe) and the predicted sentiment is obtained.
